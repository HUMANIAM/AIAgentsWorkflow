# What I want (client perspective)
A simple, user-friendly mobile app that allows users to track and categorize expenses via text or voice input, and provides organized financial summaries.

## The problem I have now:
Current expense tracking methods are cumbersome and lack automation, making it difficult to maintain regular financial oversight and categorize expenses efficiently.

## What I need:
- Integration with Google Sheets for data storage
- AI-based categorization of expenses
- End-of-year financial report generation

## What "done" means to me:
- Users can input expenses easily through text or voice
- Expenses are automatically categorized with high accuracy
- Users receive comprehensive end-of-year financial reports
