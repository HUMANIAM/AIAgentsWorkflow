# What I want (client perspective)
A browser extension that efficiently organizes selected text into categorized tabs in a Google Sheet using AI, streamlining my research and note-taking process.

## The problem I have now:
Manually categorizing and organizing saved text snippets is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to disorganized information that is difficult to manage and review later.

## What I need:
- A right-click option to send selected text to the extension.
- AI-driven categorization of text based on context.
- Automatic sorting of text into appropriate Google Sheet tabs.

## What "done" means to me:
- Text is easily sent and categorized within my Google Sheet.
- Text is sorted into the correct tab automatically by AI.
- Notes in each tab are separated by a line and a GPT-generated headline.
