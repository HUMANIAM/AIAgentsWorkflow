**GPT:** Consider a user-friendly mobile app that allows users to easily track and categorize their expenses, set budgets, and generate financial reports. Integration with bank accounts and receipt scanning could enhance functionality.
**User:** the app has a very simple idea user say what they spent with text or voice, we propose a category they confirm, we save the category | amount | message in google sheet later they can view total, and total/category organized from high to small
**GPT:** Great idea! It keeps the user experience simple and efficient. Consider adding features like automatic categorization based on common spending patterns, and possibly offering a simple dashboard for visual summaries of spending. Would you like to include notifications or reminders to encourage regular use? Also, think about integrating with popular virtual assistants for seamless voice entry.
**User:** it will be integrated with AI api endpoint to categorize and give an overall report in the end of the year
**GPT:** That sounds fantastic! Leveraging AI for categorization and end-of-year reports can provide personalized insights and improve accuracy. Ensure the AI can learn from user corrections to improve over time. Would you like to offer users the ability to set savings goals or track recurring expenses? Also, consider data security and privacy, especially with sensitive financial data.
