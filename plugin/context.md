# What I want (client perspective)
An effective solution to manage and save attention while browsing the Internet without relying on simplistic alerts or basic time recording.

## The problem I have now:
Existing solutions are too simplistic, often just alerting every 30 minutes or merely recording time spent online, which doesn't effectively help in managing attention.

## What I need:
- A more sophisticated tool or method that helps save attention while browsing.
- An approach that goes beyond simple time alerts or tracking.
- A solution that is non-intrusive yet effective in maintaining focus.

## What "done" means to me:
Having a tool or method that successfully helps manage and save attention while browsing without relying on basic alerts or time tracking, ensuring a noticeable improvement in focus and productivity.
