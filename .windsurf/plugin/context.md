# What I want (client perspective)
I want a simple browser extension that allows me to save selected text from a webpage directly into a Google Sheet. The process should be straightforward, with minimal interaction required.

## The problem I have now:
Currently, I manually select text in the browser and save it to a Google Sheet note. This process is cumbersome and inefficient, as it requires multiple steps and manual input.

## What I need:
- A browser extension that allows me to select text and save it with a single click.
- A pop-up list with options such as "save to my note," "save copy," and "select all."
- The ability to choose a specific Google Sheet tab or create a new tab for the note to be saved.
- Notes should be separated by line within each tab.
- Error handling with a pop-up error message if the save action fails.

## What "done" means to me:
The extension is considered complete when I can select text on a webpage, click a button to save it to a Google Sheet, and have it organized by tabs and lines, all without encountering errors.
