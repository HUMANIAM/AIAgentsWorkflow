# What I want (client perspective)

The bot is working but when it sends me questions, the suggested answers are generic instead of smart AI-generated ones.

## The problem I have now:
- I receive questions on Telegram ✓
- But the suggestions are always the same generic ones:
  - "Yes, that sounds good"
  - "No, let's try something else"
  - "I'm not sure, you decide what's best"
- I want the suggestions to be smart and relevant to the question

## What I need:
- When the bot sends me a question, the suggestions should be generated by AI
- The suggestions should be specific to the question being asked
- If AI fails, the generic fallback is okay

## Example of what I expect:
- Question: "What color should the app theme be?"
- Suggestions:
  1. Blue and white (professional, clean look)
  2. Dark mode with accent colors (modern, easy on eyes)
  3. Let the team decide based on best practices

## What "done" means to me:
- I receive a question with AI-generated suggestions
- The suggestions are relevant to the question
- The bot still works if AI is temporarily unavailable
```

## Steps After Confirmation

1. Update `plugin/context.md` with the above content
2. Reset `status.json` to `bootstrap_comms` phase
3. Start the bot in background
4. Run `/orchestrator`
5. Team works through SDLC phases, asking you questions on Telegram when needed
6. Final deliverable: GPT suggestions working
